			<img src="city.jpg" alt="">
			<p>
				Tashkent is the capital and largest city of Uzbekistan, as well as the most populated city in ex-Soviet Central Asia (though the larger urban centers of Urumqi in China and Kabul in Afghanistan lie well within the geographic region of Central Asia) with a population in 2018 of 2,485,900. It is located in the north-east of the country close to the Kazakhstan border. Tashkent was influenced by the Sogdian and Turkic cultures in its early history, before Islam in the 8th century AD. After its destruction by Genghis Khan in 1219, the city was rebuilt and profited from the Silk Road. From 18th to 19th century, the city became an independent city-state, before being re-conquered by the Khanate of Kokand. In 1865, it fell to the Russian Empire, and became the capital of Russian Turkestan. In Soviet times, Tashkent witnessed major growth and demographic changes due to forced deportations from throughout the Soviet Union. Today, as the capital of an independent Uzbekistan, Tashkent retains a multi-ethnic population, with ethnic Uzbeks as the majority. In 2009, the city celebrated its 2,200 years of written history. <a href="about.html">read more</a>

			<h1>Bukhara City</h1>
			<img src="chorsu.jpg" alt="">
			<p>
				Chorsu Bazaar is located across the street from Chorsu Station of the Tashkent Metro, near Kukeldosh Madrasah. "Chorsu" is a word from the Persian language, meaning "crossroads" or "four streams". Kukeldash Madrasah, built around 1570, is located at the edge of the bazaar. Bazaar is the heart of every oriental city, the center of public life, breadwinner of the whole city. Since the dawn of time bazaars appeared on the intersections of trade roads, on big squares of cities. They played role of main places of the city, where merchants, traders and common people gathered to discuss important news, to know prices, to have a rest in cozy choykhana (Uzbek café) eating pilaf and drinking green tea. Also bazaars were the places of main entertaining events of the city – theatrical performances. Tashkent Bazaar Chorsu, the age of which is more than hundred years, also was always located on the main square of the city Eski-Juva. Old bazaar constructions destroyed and went bad, but the traditional architecture remained unchanged – domed large premises. This was the only way to protect oneself from heat and dust in terms of hot and dry Asian climate.

				The madrasah is built of yellow brick, and has a traditional square shape with a big portal and an inner yard. The walls around the inner yard contain cells inhabited by the students. The portal is 20 metres (66 ft) high and contains two towers at its sides. In 1830-1831 the first floor of the madrasah was demolished, and the bricks were used to build the nearby Beklarbegi Madrasah. It was later restored.[1] The madrasah was damaged by the earthquake in 1868 and subsequently reconstructed in 1902-1903. It was reconstructed again in the 1950s and became one of only several religious buildings which survived the 1966 Tashkent earthquake. The madrasah was converted into a caravanserai in the 18th century, then it served as a fortress. In the 20th century it was a museum, first of atheism, and later of folk music. In the 1990s, the building was made a madrasah again. Like any other madrasah Kukeldash Madrasah was an educational institution. However, over the centuries Kukeldash Madrasah fell to decay not once. Throughout its long history the madrasah had rough time.

				After Uzbekistan became independent in 1991, much attention was paid to revive the nation's spiritual and cultural heritage, including recognition of historical persons who had an important role in world civilization. Among those was Amir Temur, the warlord, politician and reformer, patron of science, education, trade, culture and craft. Having established a great centralized state, he strengthened its power and greatness and also united many nations and people. Amir Temur's rule promoted science, education, culture, architecture, the fine arts, music and poetry, laying the foundations of the Temurid Renaissance. President Islam Karimov has encouraged celebration of Timur, linking the Mongol ruler's achievements with the President's own style of governnace.[2][3] Karimov declared 1996 to be the “Year of Amir Temur”, and the 660th anniversary was widely celebrated in Uzbekistan, and the Republic subsequently resolved to build a State Museum in central Tashkent, featuring the Temurids' history.
